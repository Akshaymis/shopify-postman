# Shopify Postman

As we move to Shopify Plus, we had to spend a time working on the full mapping of the Shopify API.
Unfortunately, our Account Manager said that there is no Postman Collection available for the ShopifyAPI Endpoints, so we did our own.

# How to use?

The Postman Collection file is a JSON containing all information about each request.
In order to configure the Collection to your own needs, i suggest you download the ".postman_collection" file, and "find and replace" a few things with your favorite text editor.

- apikey:password
- yourstore.myshopify.com

Once you replace this data with private credentials of your store, you will be able to use the whole Collection.

# How to know what is my API Credentials?

# Missing Endpoints

- Checkout
- User
- UsageCharge

Feel free to contribute if you believe there is something missing.
