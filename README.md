# Shopify Postman

As we move to Shopify Plus, we had to spend a time working on the full mapping of the Shopify API.
Unfortunately, our Account Manager said that there is no Postman Collection available for the ShopifyAPI Endpoints, so we did our own.

# Missing Endpoints

- Checkout
- User
- UsageCharge

# Collaboration

Feel free to contribute if you believe there is something missing.
